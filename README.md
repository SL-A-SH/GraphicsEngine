1. CMake:

    - mkdir build
    - cd build
    - cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"

    Debug vs. Release
    Debug mode: Use for development, debugging, and testing. It includes debug symbols and is slower.
    Release mode: Use for final builds and performance testing. It is optimized and faster.

    To build Debug:
    
      `cmake --build . --config Debug`
    
    To build Release:
    
      `cmake --build . --config Release`

2. Open the .sln file generated by CMake in the build directory.

3. Right-click the executable project (e.g., DirectX11Engine) and select "Set as Startup Project"
